# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-02

### Added

- Multi-strategy intersection screener mode (多策略交叉选股): run 7 preset
  strategies (MACD金叉 / 均线多头 / 放量突破 / 超卖反弹 / 趋势转强 / 创60日新高 /
  强势连涨) simultaneously and show stocks that hit ≥ N strategies, sorted by
  hit count then score. The screener tab now has a mode toggle between
  "评分选股" (standard weighted-score) and "多策略交叉" (multi-strategy
  intersection). A new `minStrategyHits` parameter controls the hit threshold.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Market sentiment thermometer (市场情绪温度计): the market tab now shows
  up/down/limit-up/limit-down/broken-board counts, a consecutive-board ladder
  (连板梯队, 2板/3板/… with counts), the highest board, and an expandable
  limit-up pool list (name, board count, industry; click to open the detail
  popup). New `/api/leekbox/sentiment` payload with `up/down/flat`, `broken`,
  `ladder`, `maxBoard` and `ztList` from the Eastmoney topic pools plus
  whole-market breadth.
- ETF / 可转债 / LOF support:
  - Rank pool selector in the market tab: 沪深A股 / ETF·场内基金 / 可转债 /
    LOF (Eastmoney `b:MK0021` / `b:MK0354` / `m:1+t:5,m:0+t:10`), reusing the
    existing rank route with a `node` parameter.
  - `normalizeCode` now accepts 5-digit codes (ETF/LOF) and maps 11xxxx
    (沪市可转债) to `sh`, so ETF/bond codes work in watchlist, quote, kline
    and search.
  - Search now returns A-share stocks, on-exchange funds (ETF/LOF, Classify
    `Fund`) and convertible bonds (Classify `Bond`) instead of stocks only.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-31

### Added

- Watchlist import/export: export the watchlist as a JSON backup (group-aware,
  re-importable) or as UTF-8 CSV for Excel/WPS; import from JSON, CSV or plain
  pasted text (one stock per line, `code[,name[,group]]`, quoted cells and a
  `code`/`代码` header row tolerated). Two modes: merge (skip duplicates,
  default) and replace (with a client-side confirmation). Imported codes are
  normalized the same way as manual adds, invalid lines are reported back.
- Toolbar row in the watchlist tab with 导入 / 覆盖导入 / 导出 JSON / 导出 CSV
  buttons and a status line; the toolbar is also available when the watchlist
  is empty.

### Fixed

- `normalizeCode` had its function body jammed onto the signature line.
- `writeWatchlist` failure path contained dead code (a no-op `require` check)
  that never cleaned up the leftover `.tmp` file; it now unlinks it.
- Row-level open-detail clicks no longer fire when the click lands on an
  interactive child: changing the group `<select>` in the watchlist (or any
  future select/button inside a quote row) no longer pops the detail window.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- Stock detail popup windows (THS-style): draggable, stackable, ESC / backdrop
  layer-by-layer close; opened by clicking a stock name in any tab including the
  watchlist.
- Candlestick K-line chart with forward-adjusted data (qfq), MA5/10/20 overlays,
  volume subchart, last-price dashed line and a hover crosshair legend.
- Multi-source 7x24 news feed: Sina zhibo + Eastmoney fast news + Jin10 flashes,
  merged newest-first with per-source filter chips and source badges.
- Important-news highlighting: official flags (Jin10 star / Sina focus) plus a
  keyword fallback (突发/重磅/重大/紧急/超预期).
- Screener UI redesign: segmented pool picker, range inputs, grouped technical
  signals with per-group counters, gradient run button, rank medals and score
  tier pills in results.

### Changed

- Main panel window title shortened to 韭菜盒子.

### Removed

- Intraday minute chart from the stock detail view (per user preference).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- Initial release: realtime indices board, quote search + ranking tables,
  persisted watchlist, multi-signal screener with weighted scoring,
  Sina-only 7x24 news feed, stock detail page with minute chart and K-line.
